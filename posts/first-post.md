Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side
Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at
**build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML
on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js let's you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for
each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for
most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.

## How to add styles at the \<code> Tag

``` css
code {
  background-color: #eee;
  font-style: italic;
  font-weight: bold;
  padding: .2rem 1rem;
  border-radius: 8px;
  width: 100%;
}
```
