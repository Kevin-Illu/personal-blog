### Why i pay for this keyboard?

Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side
Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

Static Generation is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at
**build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
Server-side Rendering
is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js let's you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for
each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for
most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.
